    After the feedback that I was given on tuesday, I decided that one of the
key features that I would want to implement to make my project more
user-friendly was to clean up the way the report tab displayed information
and the way I present breadth-first search (BFS) to the user. Hence, I decided
to add a mechanism to each entry box on the report tab that allows one to
scroll through a given entry using a particular entry indexer (displayed by
the gray box shown when an entry box is active) and add a button dedicated to
applying BFS to the graph given a particular clicked node and then displaying
that in the metrics for each node in the graph.
